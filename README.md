# 💻 Default Linux Image

### ❓ Purpose
Image for creating a temporary container.  

_Explanation_: it's not the intended way to use `Docker`, but it's convenient 
for me to have a pre-configured `Linux` with all I need.

### 🛠 Installs:
- languages
    - `go`
    - `rust`
- `homebrew`
- `task` for Taskfiles
- `zsh` + some plugins
- `zoxide`
- a bunch of `CLI` tools
